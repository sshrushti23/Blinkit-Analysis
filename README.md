### Dashboard Description

A data dashboard is a visual display of key metrics and data points, designed to provide a quick, at-a-glance overview of performance, trends, or other important information. It typically combines various charts, graphs, and tables to present a comprehensive view of a dataset.

**Key Components:**

* **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** Prominently displayed metrics such as **Total Sales**, **Number of Items**, **Average Rating**, or **Average Sales**. These are often highlighted in large, easy-to-read boxes at the top of the dashboard.
* **Visualizations:** A mix of charts and graphs that illustrate data patterns. This can include:
    * **Bar charts** to compare different categories (e.g., sales by product type or location).
    * **Line or area charts** to show trends over time (e.g., sales performance across years).
    * **Donut or pie charts** to show the composition of a whole (e.g., sales distribution by outlet size).
* **Filter Panel:** An interactive section, usually on the side, that allows users to drill down into the data. Filters can be applied by **location**, **size**, **item type**, or other relevant categories.
* **Detailed Tables:** A section, often at the bottom, that provides a granular breakdown of the data. This could be a table showing performance by **Outlet Type**, including columns for **Total Sales**, **Number of Items**, **Average Sales**, and other metrics.

The overall layout is organized and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate from high-level summaries to more specific details, making it a powerful tool for monitoring business performance and making informed decisions.
