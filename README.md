# Blinkit- Data Analysis


I cannot access local files or images from your computer, so I'm unable to view the `pps.jpg` file you've uploaded. However, based on the file name and the context of a "github readme" request, I can provide a template for a README file.

A good README file is crucial for any GitHub repository. It acts as the project's front page, providing an overview, instructions, and context for anyone who stumbles upon it. A well-structured README helps others understand what your project is, how to use it, and how they can contribute.
